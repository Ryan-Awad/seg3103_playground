# SEG3103 Playground 

This is my repository for Lab #1 in the SEG3103 course at uOttawa. 

To run the code in each `newmath_*` directory, run `./bin/run`. 

To test the code in each `newmath_*` directory, run `./bin/test`.

Screenshots proving I can run the code and the tests can be found in `assets/`.
